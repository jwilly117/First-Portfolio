# Portfolio - Old

### Summary
This project was my first portfolio and is relatively outdated now, and unlinked from all of my other sites. 

### The goal of this project
Being one of my first "full" sites, the goal is simply to display some information about myself, contact info, and add in some links to some of my earlier projects. The site has since been redone several times and this one simply serves as a reference point for how far things have come since then. 

### File Structure
This is a three page site using basic html and CSS, so its only those three basic pages constructed in html, and an assets folder which contains the few images used on the site and the CSS to style the pages. 

### Instructions
Simply browse the site to see its contents, Please note this is very outdated and is not used to represent any current skill level. 

### Deployment & Screenshot

### Future of this project
The project now only serves as a reference point to look back at some of my earlier work.
